---

### 3. Quiz Game
> A simple text-based quiz that asks 5 general knowledge questions, checks answers, scores the user, gives feedback, and lets the user replay the game.

**File:** `Quiz game.py`

---

### 4. Basic Calculator
> A simple calculator that performs basic operations (+, -, *, /) with input validation, division-by-zero checks, and an option to retry.

**File:** `Basic Calculator.py`

---

### 5. To-Do List App
> A simple task manager that lets users add, view, and delete tasks with a clean menu interface and input validation.

**File:** `To-Do list.py`

---

### 6. Contact Book App
> A menu-based contact manager where users can add, view, search, and delete contacts using a Python dictionary.

**File:** `Contact Book.py`

---

### 7. Student Grade Tracker
> A menu-driven app to add, view, update, and delete student grades using a dictionary. Handles case-insensitive names and gives clean feedback for each operation.

**File:** `Student Grade Tracker.py`

---

### 8. Simple Notepad App
> A file-based notepad where users can type, save, and view notes using `.txt` files with Python's file handling tools.

**File:** `Simple Notepad.py`

---

### 9. Dice Roller Game
> A fun mini app that simulates a dice roll using Python's `random` module. Keeps rolling until the user chooses to exit.

**File:** `Dice roller.py`

---

### 10. Countdown Timer App
> A countdown timer that lets the user set a number of seconds, shows a smooth startup animation using `end=""`, and counts down with `time.sleep()` delays.

**File:** `Simple Timer.py`

---

### 11. File Organizer App
> Automatically organizes files in the current directory by type. Moves images, documents, and videos into separate folders using the `os` module.

**File:** `Simple File Organizer.py`

---

### 12. Quiz Game (Error-Handled)
> An upgraded quiz game that accepts flexible answers, handles invalid or blank inputs using `try-except`, and offers a replay option. Now crash-proof and user-friendly.

**File:** `Quiz advanced.py`

---

### 13. Student Report Card (OOP)
> A class-based mini project using Object-Oriented Programming. It stores student details, calculates the average of three subject scores, and assigns a grade. Includes methods for data management and a full report display.

**File:** `Student Report Card.py`

---

### 14. Inheritance Demo (Person â†’ Student & Teacher)
> Demonstrates the concept of inheritance in Python OOP. A base `Person` class is extended by both `Student` and `Teacher` classes using `super()`. Each child class includes its own custom attributes and methods.

**File:** `Mini Inheritance Task.py`

---

### 15. Animal Sound Simulator (Method Overriding)
> Demonstrates method overriding in Python OOP. A base `Animal` class has a `make_sound()` method that is overridden by child classes `Dog` and `Cat` to produce unique outputs.

**File:** `Animal Sound Simulator.py`

---

### 16. Personal Utility Toolkit (Custom Package)
> A custom Python package (`utils`) containing modules for greetings, basic maths, and text tools. Demonstrates modular coding and package structuring. Main script imports and uses these modules.

**Files and Structure:**
- utils/
  - __init__.py
  - greetings.py
  - maths.py
  - texttools.py
- main2.py

---

### 17. Student Report Card System (OOP + Custom Error Handling)
> A command-line tool that collects student marks, calculates average, assigns grades, and handles invalid input using a custom exception (`NegativeMarksError`). Structured using Object-Oriented Programming for clean logic and easy expansion.

**File:** `Student Report.py`

---

### 18. Random Password Generator
> Generates a strong random password using letters, digits, and symbols. The user specifies the password length, and the program randomly selects characters using Python's `random` and `string` modules.

**File:** `Random Password Generator.py`
